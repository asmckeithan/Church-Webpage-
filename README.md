Practice Project for myself to rally explore and gain the nesscessary experience to truly understand building a webpage.
I statred this project as a help to my community and church. 
The goal or requirement of the customer is to simply add a more modern approach to sunday service. I have recently purchased nfc tags or stickers to place on the back of the church chairs and i need to create a url or webpage to send the community to keep up with church events and 
ways they can upport or make donations. The most challenging part about this role is I am a bootcamp student, who has not had the proffessional practice and skills and a 4 year graduate. It has been almost a year since, I have used these skills and It definitely going to be a challenge as the project continues 

Step 1. VS code getting a foudation of a page by creting an html file
Step 2. Link your actions to githup 
Step 3. Heroku is my launch page so I need to connect to the two so everything is all synced together.
